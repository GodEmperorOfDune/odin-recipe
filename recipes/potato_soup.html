                Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned,
                about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; chop roughly when cool enough to handle.

                Working in batches, pour potatoes into the same skillet, and cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. 
                Remove potatoes to a slow cooker. Stir in chicken broth. Dollop cheese spread on top; scatter bacon on top.
                Cover slow cooker and cook on High until potatoes are very tender, 3 to 4 hours.

                If desired, ladle some of the soup, no more than halfway full, into a high powered blender. 
                Cover and hold lid down with a potholder; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend, about 45 seconds.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Pour soup back into slow cooker. Stir to combine; serve immediately.
